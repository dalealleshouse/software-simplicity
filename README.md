# Complexity is Evil Incarnate

![Complexity Battle](complexity-battle.jpg)

Join the band of noble warriors that vow to rid the land of this wretched beast
that plagues our repositories, terrorizes our backlogs, and devours the fruits
of our labor. Complexity's reign of terror must end! But be warned, only the
true of heart can hope to survive an encounter with this most despicable of
creatures. The bones of many a noble programmer lie strewn about the brute's
lair. Scorching fire, razor-sharp teeth, and crushing death await ye. Yet for
those courageous enough to face the trials, glory, honor, and immortality await!

Wait, wait, wait... Before you go rushing off to embrace your eminent demise,
allow me to equip you with the required armaments. Knowledge, that is the only
weapon that can save you from your peril. You must have a profound understanding
of the Complexity dragon if you hope to slay it.

Now that I have you attention, let's get serious...
