### Quiz 1

Classify each source of complexity as either essential or accidental:
1. Design patterns
1. Regulatory Laws
1. Requirements
1. Friction between software tools (e.g. Karma and IntelliJ)

> 1. Accidental - a design pattern is a tool used to manage complexity, but also
>    has inherit complexity of it's own
> 1. Essential - the laws regulating a process should never be eliminated
> 1. Essential - software must meet requirements regardless of the inherit
>    complexity
> 1. Accidental - the tools used to create software have little bearing on the
>    problem domain. This is the absolute worst type of accidental complexity
>    because it adds *NO* value to the solution.


Is it possible to completely eliminate accidental complexity?
- Yes
- No

> No, accidental complexity is an asymptote. Unless computers are completely
> removed from the solution, accidental complexity will exist.
